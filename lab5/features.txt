== Added Features ==

1. Registering new users

Through this feature, users can register new credentials which they can use to login.

Usage: /register <username> <password>

Note: We assume that usernames and passwords don't contain any spaces.

In terms of implementation, this feature introduces a new message type 'REGISTER_USER'.
It also introduces a corresponding RU_ACK and RU_NACK.
RU_ACK acknowledges that the credentials were successfully registered.
RU_NACK indicates a failure to register credentials for reasons such as the username being taken.

To presist added credentials, we now store credentials in a text file to act as a pseudo database.

2. Direct Messages

Through this feature, users can send other users private messages irrespective of sessions.

Usage: /dm <username> <message>

For the implementation, this feature introduces the message type 'DIRECT_MESSAGE'.
It also introduces a corresponding DM_ACK and DM_NACK.
DM_ACK acknowledges that the message was successfully sent to the user.
DM_NACK indicates a failure to send a message for reasons such as:
    - username not found
    - user not logged in
    - invalid user (can't send dm to self)

Note: Both of these features involve sending data that consists of multiple arguments (i.e username & password).
    So we encode the data using run length encoding to separate them in a defined manner.
